We are going to create a react Weather App.

Make use of the following API https://openweathermap.org/price

What we need is an application where you can search for a certain city or place and display the current weather.
You can request details, this should navigate you to a seperate page where you display the 3 hours forecast over 5 days.

You can use the Geocoding API to get a city it's latitude and longitude.

Good luck!
